# loan prediction

## üìñ Introduction  
This project describes the dataset used for the *Loan Default Prediction* task, explains where the data comes from, lists the project contributors, and provides a complete explanation of each file in the dataset.  

The main goal of the project is to build predictive models that estimate the probability of a client defaulting on a loan (*binary target*).  

The dataset contains three files:  
1. *application_data.csv*  
2. *previous_application.csv*  
3. *columns_description.csv*  

The workflow involves combining these files, performing preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to create robust predictive models.

## üéØ Objective  
The objective of this case study is to apply *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* techniques in a real-world business scenario within the banking and financial services domain.  
The focus is to develop a basic understanding of *risk analytics* by analyzing customer data and their previous loan applications.  

By combining demographic, financial, and historical loan information, the study aims to identify key factors that influence the risk of default.  
This will help in minimizing financial losses for the bank by improving lending decisions and building a stronger risk assessment framework.

## üìä Dataset Overview  

The dataset comprises information about *loan applicants* and their *credit histories*.  

### Primary responsibilities for each file  
- *application_data.csv* ‚Äî main data: client-level features and the TARGET label (0 = non-default, 1 = default). Used for preprocessing, training, and evaluating models.  
- *previous_application.csv* ‚Äî historical loan applications of the same clients. Used to create additional features (counts, averages, ratios) summarizing past behavior for each SK_ID_CURR.  
- *columns_description.csv* ‚Äî column dictionary: definitions and explanations of columns across the dataset. Used as a reference during analysis.  

### Main Workflow  
1. Start with application_data.csv for cleaning, encoding, and baseline modeling.  
2. Aggregate previous_application.csv by SK_ID_CURR to create historical features, then merge them into the main table.  
3. Use columns_description.csv as the authoritative reference for column meanings and units.
